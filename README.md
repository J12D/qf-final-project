QF Final Project
================

ALWAYS do a **git pull** before starting to work to make sure you are working with the most recent version of our repository.

Don't push every local file to the repo, just add the files containing code (or data) with `git add` and then push them via `git push`. Metadata files and the likes are usually not helpful for anyone but you and thus generally not be in the repo.

This is the code repository for our group project in 15.495.
